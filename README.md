# Quest-system-in-Unity3D
Implement in your Unity project simple quest system. If you wanna save the quest data, than I highly reccomend to get Easy Save 3 asset from unity asset store.

How to implement:
1. Attach all scripts except scriptable stuff to some object in your scene.
2. Create an UI and fill all references in scripts to them.
3. If you don't have unity Easy Save 3 asset, than remove the code which depends on it.
